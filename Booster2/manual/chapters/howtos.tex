\section{Adding a new primitive type}
\label{sec:addNewType}
To add a new type to Booster:
\begin{itemize}
\item Add it to the Booster2.sdf file, and add a corresponding 'Extent' 
\item Make sure the syntax is disallowed by the tokenizer (common.sdf)
\item Add the rules for the type in library/basicTypes.str
\item Ensure the correct type inferences can be made in
  \verb|infer-types| for any instances of the types, and the
  corresponding extents. (Currently in \verb|elaborate.str|)
\item Ensure there is a corresponding type in the Relational.sdf
  syntax, and that the output methods are appropriate.
\end{itemize}
